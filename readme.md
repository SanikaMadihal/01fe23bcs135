# Portfolio: Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)

Welcome to my formal DAA portfolio. As a third-year Computer Science Engineering student at **KLE Technological University**, this repository serves as a comprehensive record of my journey through the Design and Analysis of Algorithms course.

## 📘 Introduction to DAA

**Design and Analysis of Algorithms** is the cornerstone of computer science. It involves the systematic study of the efficiency, scalability, and correctness of various computational procedures. 

Throughout this course, I have explored how to move beyond simply writing code that "works" to writing code that is optimized for speed (**Time Complexity**) and memory (**Space Complexity**). This subject has provided me with the tools to solve complex real-world problems using structured mathematical and logical frameworks.

## 🏗️ Course Project: Smart City Planning

My course project focuses on **City Planning** using the core principles of DAA. By applying advanced data structures and algorithmic strategies, I have designed a system to optimize urban infrastructure, such as traffic management, resource distribution, and efficient routing.

### Key Objectives:
* **Infrastructure Optimization:** Using graph-based algorithms (like MST) to find the most efficient layouts for city utilities and power grids.
* **Efficient Resource Distribution:** Implementing advanced tree structures for quick data retrieval and management of city assets and population clusters.
* **Real-time Decision Making:** Utilizing shortest-path algorithms to optimize logistics and minimize emergency service response times.

## 📝 Course Reflection

The **Course Reflection** file is a critical part of this repository. It documents my shift from brute-force thinking to more sophisticated approaches such as **Divide and Conquer**, **Greedy methods**, and **Dynamic Programming**. 

It highlights how implementing algorithms like **Kruskal’s** for city-wide networking or **Segment Trees** for population data queries has improved my ability to design high-performance systems. Understanding the trade-offs between different algorithmic paradigms has been the most valuable takeaway from this semester.
